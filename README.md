# LTW Secure Code Generator — Official Documentation & Repository Governance

Welcome to the public documentation and repository governance directory for **LTW Secure Code Generator**.

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING SOURCE CODE:**  
> This public repository contains **strictly documentation, legal frameworks, and configuration metadata**. The underlying application source code, execution binaries, and proprietary implementation scripts are **NOT** published, hosted, or accessible within this public project.

---

## Executive Summary

**LTW Secure Code Generator** is a zero-trust client-side utility engineered to produce cryptographically secure random authentication tokens, high-entropy passwords, and cryptographic keys. Designed with absolute privacy in mind, the application executes entirely within the client's local browser runtime using native Web Cryptography APIs, ensuring zero external network dependencies, zero remote telemetry, and zero server-side storage.

---

## Architectural & Security Highlights

- **Pure Client-Side Cryptography:** Utilizes standard browser Web Crypto APIs (`crypto.getRandomValues`) to ensure entropy generation is non-deterministic and local to the user's system.
- **Zero External Dependencies:** Built without reliance on third-party remote scripts, external CDNs, or secondary endpoints, eliminating supply-chain attack vectors.
- **Isolated Local Persistence:** Retains user settings and generated output solely within browser `localStorage`, featuring an immediate client-side data purge mechanism for total isolation.
- **Strict Source-Available Licensing:** Protected by custom legal conditions that strictly limit repository permissions to read-only inspection and educational evaluation.
